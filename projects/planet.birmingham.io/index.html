              <p>The last vanity song for a while, I promise — and this one’s definitely not punk. In my defence, it
                started
                life as fucked-folk, like “Femme Fatale” by the Velvet Underground. But as the lyrics firmed up, I
                started
                thinking about a serenade (“a musical greeting performed for a lover… an evening piece, one to be
                performed
                on a quiet and pleasant evening”) as that’s what the lyrics are about, albeit with a bittersweetness not
                reflected in the arrangement.</p>

              <p> It was written in Cambodia and Barcelona. I wrote an alternate third verse which I don’t remember, and
                I
                don’t have the handwritten draft any more. If I do remember, I’ll record it in fucked-folk style.</p>

              <p>Footage of the girl is from “Weg zum Nachbarn” by Lutz Mommartz, 1968.</p>

              <p>The girl in the room<br>
                talks at dusk of musk and sandalwood<br>
                Of warm winter mornings<br>
                and cool summer nights.<br>
                Telling tales without tomorrows<br>
                of her yesterdays and ancient times;<br>
                of a castle in the birch trees<br>
                in the calmness of twilight.</p>

              <p>The girl in the room<br>
                is thunder-lightning: fiercely beautiful;<br>
                weighed down with words, then musical,<br>
                with her faces in her moon.<br>
                She asks if you could love her<br>
                and before you can recover<br>
                she needs to be somewhere or other.<br>
                Through the trees, the breeze sings tunes.</p>

              <p>The girl in the room<br>
                talks at sunset in her box of text,<br>
                of monsoon rain and games and sex<br>
                and the ruins where bluebells bloom.<br>
                Lost in feelings like a forest,<br>
                there are no certain maps to happiness;<br>
                She spills wine on her Chinese dress,<br>
                and the breeze brings you tunes.</p>
